# AR-T-Shirt
Created an Augmented Reality T-Shirt that is able to play a video of Kawhi Leonard making his game winning shot in game 7 against the Philadelphia 76ers. What motivated me to make this application was during the summer I was working at Zero Gravity Labs where I was working on an Augmented Reality application. So I thought to myself why not make your own Augmented Reality project and since I am such a die hard raptors fan I connected my love of basketball and technology into one thing. 
# Demo
